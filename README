README
-------------------------------------------------------
Gold Chase is a game that involves multiple players,
all utilizing the same shared memory, which is drawn
out as a map. The goal of the game is to get the real
gold, before everyone else. Once you pick the real 
gold up, you take it to any open exit on the map. 

Watch out for the fools gold!

INSTRUCTIONS

To start the game, type:

The map file must be named mymap.txt.

Currently, there is no check to see if a player
has already been selected. It is assumed that the
player specified at the command line, does not
already exist in the game.
